# CatchApp

A React application that allows two people to chat with each other using the internet. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## instillation

After successful login, the chat page will appear to the user. At the left side, the user will see his contacts. By pressing the person with the plus icon, the user may add new contacts. Pressing a contact will make the chat appear in the right side of the page. At the right side of the page, at the bottom bar, appears the different types of messages the user can send.
At this moment, CatchApp allows sending messages of several types:

* Regular text message

To send a regular message, just enter your text in the input field and press enter or press the right plane icon. If you will press the clip icon, two different icons will appear: pressing the image icon will allow to choose an image type file and send it. pressing the video icon will allow to choose a video type file and send it. Pressing the mic icon will allow to record from the device and send the recording.
